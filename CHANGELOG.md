## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Dynamic (prognostic) canopy structure + the S↔F coupling adapter (Phase-3 scale-up step 6).** The
  multi-individual canopy's per-individual carbon pools are now PROGNOSTIC: they accumulate the daily
  `bm_inc` (= Σ daily NPP, per-m² patch basis — the new `npp_ind` flux) and GROW at the annual boundary
  via a faithful DIFFERENTIABLE port of the LPJmL-FIT year-end sequence `turnover_tree.c` →
  `allocation_tree.c` → `allometry_tree.c`. New `FDiff` API: `AllocParams`, `TreePools`, `grow_individual`
  (reproduction reserve + sapwood→heartwood + summergreen leaf/root recycle + pipe-model allocation +
  allometry), `_alloc_residual`/`_solve_leaf_inc` (a fixed-graph damped-Newton allocation solve — the
  λ-solve AD pattern, not the C's bisection), `individual_from_pools`/`_patch_fpars` (getfpar
  layered-light recompute as heights grow), `rollout_canopy_years` (the multi-year coupled loop),
  `tebs_allocparams`. Verified line-by-line against the C source (9-agent extraction workflow +
  adversarial re-derivation).
  - **Decisive validation:** the pipe-model invariant `leaf ≈ k_latosa·sapwood/(wooddens·H·sla)` holds
    after allocation to **max rel. error 2.9e-16**; carbon conservation `Δ(pools) = bm_net − turnover` is
    exact; **ForwardDiff `d(height)/d(bm_inc)` & `d(sapwood)/d(bm_inc)` match finite differences**; a
    coupled multi-year rollout (2009 start + 2010 forcing + the C's `bm_inc`) gives **year-1 mean tree
    height 9.34 m = the C's actual 2010 value** (from 2009's 9.21) and an 8-year trajectory grows smoothly
    with no blow-up.
  - **`FDiffFastCore <: AbstractFastCore` — `AbstractFastCore.step!` no longer throws.** Daily
    `step!(fc, state::SharedState, bc::SToF, forcing::AtmForcing) -> FToE` maps the shared per-layer soil
    water ↔ the `SoilColumn`, self-computes daylength/GSI-phenology/dynamic-albedo `eeq`, runs one
    `daily_step_canopy`, **writes the soil water back into `SharedState.w` in place**, and returns the
    daily `FToE` (`LE = λ·ET`); the year-end `annual_step!(fc, state) -> FToS` grows the prognostic
    structure and returns the conserved increment for S — the flux-then-integrate S↔F handoff (DESIGN §8).
  - **A load-bearing per-m² maintenance-respiration fix:** `daily_step_canopy` had fed per-individual
    pools into the maintenance term against per-m² GPP/leaf-resp; added `nind` to `FDiff.Individual` and
    the `×nind` factor (`npp_tree.c:51`) so NPP is per-m² consistent (the committed water/light baselines
    are unchanged). **Known residual (the immediate follow-up):** F_diff's self-computed canopy NPP still
    over-respires (≈ −25 vs the C's ≈ +512 gC/m²/yr) — an un-gated leaf-respiration aggregation issue
    (the maintenance constants match the C exactly); until calibrated, the coupled loop uses a `bm_inc`
    crutch (the C's per-individual NPP — the same kernel-isolation methodology used for the FAPAR/PET
    crutches), and a carbon-deficit individual stagnates rather than blowing up the pipe-model height.
  - New gates `test/testitems/dynamic_structure_tests.jl` (allocation invariant, conservation, growth,
    AD; 30 tests) + `test/testitems/coupling_tests.jl` (the `FDiffFastCore` adapter + coupled loop; 15
    tests), self-contained on the committed 2010 reference. Data reconstruction
    `scripts/extract_fdiff_individuals_multiyear.py` (2008–2011 per-individual pools incl. heartwood) +
    committed `references/hainich_structure_growth.txt`; driver `scripts/validate_fdiff_structure.jl`.
    Report `docs/phase3_fdiff_cbinary_validation.md` §12. Full suite **25,856 pass / 0 fail / 4 broken**;
    JET/Aqua/gradient green; Runic-clean.
- **Differentiable multi-layer soil water for `F_diff` (Phase-3 scale-up step 2).** Replaced the single
  soil bucket with a 23-layer differentiable column (`FDiff.SoilColumn`, `FDiffStateML`,
  `daily_step_ml`/`rollout_daily_ml`, `hainich_soilcolumn`): fill-to-field-capacity infiltration
  cascade, Jackson-1996 β root distribution (D95 ≈ 115 cm → ~93 % of roots in the top 1 m), per-layer
  root-weighted transpiration withdrawal, and top-300 mm quadratic soil evaporation. Per-layer
  capacities are taken from the C run's own `whc_nat` output (no pedotransfer port); the runtime stays
  dependency-free and water closes to ~1e-12 mm.
  - Validated on Hainich (same FAPAR-driven harness): **GPP daily correlation 0.76 → 0.93**,
    **transpiration 0.91 → 0.96**, and root-zone water now representable per layer (r = 0.87) — at
    essentially unchanged levels. This **localizes the residual transpiration/GPP level gaps to the
    demand-side / single-representative-individual step, not soil supply** (the next scale-up item).
  - New gate `test/testitems/multilayer_soil_tests.jl` (per-day water closure, no-NaN, soil-water +
    GPP/transp correlations vs the C binary, ForwardDiff differentiability, drift baseline) with
    committed `references/hainich_soilcolumn.txt` + `hainich_ml_baseline_2010.txt`. Report
    `docs/phase3_fdiff_cbinary_validation.md` §8. Full suite **25,788 pass / 0 fail**. ForwardDiff
    differentiates the layered rollout; Enzyme reverse-mode through it is a documented follow-up.
- **`F_diff` ↔ LPJmL-FIT C-binary quantitative validation on the prototype cell (Phase-3 scale-up
  step 1).** `F_diff` driven by Hainich's (global-grid cell **42490**) REAL daily `.clm` forcing + the
  C binary's ACTUAL daily FAPAR (kernel-isolation drive), compared to LPJmL-FIT's own daily
  GPP/transp/PET. **PET/radiation path validated tight** (daily ratio 1.05, r 0.999); **GPP seasonal
  dynamics captured** (annual r 0.96, within-year growing-season daily r 0.96) with level −42%;
  **transpiration timing captured** (r 0.91–0.97) with level +40–47% — the level offsets attributed
  to the documented multi-PFT/representative-individual + 23-layer-soil scale-up gaps (photosynthesis
  kernel `#define`s are byte-identical, so not kernel bugs).
  - New: `scripts/run_fdiff_validation_cell.sh` (single-cell daily re-run adding daily FAPAR + NV_LAI +
    annual FPC_STAND/LAI_STAND), `scripts/extract_fdiff_validation_inputs.py` (LPJmL `.clm` YEARCELL
    reader — validated against the model's own `d_prec` to 0.0 — + `petpar2` daylength + C-target
    extraction), `scripts/validate_fdiff_vs_cbinary.jl` (multi-year analysis driver).
  - New gate `test/testitems/cbinary_validation_tests.jl` (committed one-year 2010 reference:
    `hainich_{forcing,cbinary_targets,fdiff_baseline}_2010.*`) + a `ReferenceTests` drift alarm on
    `F_diff`'s own annual totals on real forcing. Replaces the "`F_diff` pinned against ITSELF" note.
    Report `docs/phase3_fdiff_cbinary_validation.md`; metrics
    `artifacts/metrics/phase3_fdiff_cbinary_validation.json`. Full suite **25,768 pass / 0 fail**.
  - `F_diff` additions (AD-safe; the numerical-regression baseline is unchanged): `Structure.alphaa`
    (PAR-use fraction, default 1.0; TeBS 0.55), the SLA-dependent Vcmax cap (`PhotoParams.issla`,
    default off), an **external-FAPAR drive mode** (`daily_step`/`rollout`/new `rollout_daily` accept a
    per-day `fapar`), and `tebs_params()`/`tebs_structure()` (the beech PFT-3 set). The λ-solve Newton
    iterate is now `clamp`ed to the physical bracket `[0.02, 0.85]` (fixes a deep-winter low-light NaN;
    a `smooth_clamp` was rejected because `softplus(β·huge)` overflows the AD dual). That clamp is a
    conditional, so **Enzyme reverse-mode now uses `set_runtime_activity`** (still exact vs finite
    differences; ForwardDiff unaffected; the gradient-correctness gate is unchanged).
- **⚠️ Corrected the prototype-cell index:** Hainich (DE-Hai) in the **global orderA grid** (all
  ground-truth + daily data) is 0-based index **42490** (lat 51.25/lon 10.25), NOT `28008` (= Sonoran
  desert in that grid; 28008 is Hainich only in the repo default `-DSINGLESITE` grid). Fixed in
  `MEMORY.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `config/paths.yaml`.
- **Differentiable fast core (`F_diff`) — early one-cell spike (ADR 0014/0015).** Built F
  differentiable from the start (owner decision superseding the F1-now/F2-later split): the shared
  **allometry/diagnostics** library (`src/allometry.jl` — pipe-model height, Jucker 2022 crown/stem,
  LAI, Beer–Lambert FPC, pure & differentiable), a **smooth-surrogate** library (`src/fdiff_smoothops.jl`
  — softplus/smoothmin/max/clamp with tested `log(2)/β` deviation bounds), and the **`F_diff` daily
  biophysics** (`src/fdiff.jl` — C3/C4 Haxeltine & Prentice photosynthesis, the λ ci:ca supply/demand
  solve, Priestley–Taylor PET/ET, soil-water bucket + snow, Lloyd–Taylor respiration; pure
  `daily_step` + 365-day `rollout`). Same equations as the LPJmL-FIT C core, C-source constants.
  **Runtime is dependency-free**; AD is a test-time tool (ADR 0014).
  - **Gradient-correctness gate MET:** Enzyme reverse-mode **and** ForwardDiff match FiniteDifferences
    to ~1e-11 for `d(annual NPP)/dx` (x = CO₂, emax, α_c3, initial soil water) through the full daily
    rollout incl. the λ Newton solve and the autoregressive soil-water coupling — no NaN/Inf. This is
    the differentiability the reference repos do not demonstrate (they detach physics).
  - New gates: `allometry_tests.jl` (values/limits/monotonicity/types), `smoothops_tests.jl`
    (surrogate deviation bounds), `fdiff_physics_tests.jl` (water closure ~1e-12, boundedness,
    limiting cases, determinism, Float32), filled-in `gradient_correctness_tests.jl` (AD vs FD) and
    `numerical_regression_tests.jl` (annual-totals baseline `references/fdiff_annual_totals.txt`).
    Full suite: **25,756 pass / 0 fail** (JET clean; a latent `@kwdef` unbound-`T` bug in
    `FDiffParams` that JET caught was fixed). Reuse map + citations in ADR 0015 / CITATION.cff.
  - Report: `docs/phase3_fdiff_spike.md` (feasibility verdict, non-smoothness issues hit, effort
    estimate ≈ 2.5–4 months to cover all of F). `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` §2.3/§6 updated.
- **Phase 0 (DESIGN)** deliverable `DESIGN.md`: re-verified the two load-bearing LPJmL-FIT
  findings (daily output is config-only; no surface energy balance), froze the shared-state
  vector and the S↔F↔E interface contract, froze the data schema, and resolved the build/run
  recipe and input-data paths. Adversarially reviewed (16/22 findings applied).
- Engineering scaffold to `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`: Julia package skeleton
  (`LPJmLFITEmulator`), `@testitem` scientific-gate placeholders (conservation, gradient
  correctness, rollout stability, determinism, resilience battery, …), GitHub Actions CI
  (tests/format/docs/python/TagBot/dependabot), Documenter.jl documentation (Diátaxis +
  citations + model card + datasheets), ADRs for decisions already made, curated Mermaid +
  code/config-derived diagrams, and reproducibility wiring (StableRNGs, DrWatson, DVC, MLflow).
- Resolved `config/paths.yaml` and `config/hpc_slurm.yaml` to the real PIK cluster values
  (LPJROOT `/home/jamirp/lpjml56fit`, verified modules, production input/restart paths,
  Python env `py311_new`).

- **Component S canonical port** (`feat/port-slow-emulator`, ADR 0012): ported the slow
  distributional emulator from the now-frozen sibling `/p/projects/open/Jamir/emulator` into
  `python/src/lpjmlfit_emulator/` — `transforms.py` (signed-log + isotonic monotone links),
  `drivers.py` (annual climate/CO₂ aggregation, xarray-guarded), `features.py`
  (`build_cell_year_feats` + climclusterpy/NetCDF-guarded eco diagnostics), `baseline.py` (the
  DIRECT non-recursive climate→distribution emulator + `ResidualRegressor`/`add_competition`),
  `train.py` (holdout/train/eval helpers, matplotlib-guarded), extended `data.py` (validated
  `load_ind` loader + generalized `build_patch_summaries`, frozen 29-col schema kept), a curated
  `__init__.py` public API, and `python/config/config.yaml`. Each ported module carries a
  provenance header and was adversarially fidelity-checked against its source. New tests
  (`test_transforms.py`, `test_features.py`, `test_noise_floor.py`, extended `test_data.py`) →
  **49 passed / 6 skipped** in `py311_new`; 56 passed + ruff-clean in the locked CI env.
- `noise_floor.py`: seed1-vs-seed2 noise-floor diagnostics (per-cell magnitude floor
  `median|s1-s2|/s1`, ranking ceiling, per-cell error distribution p50/p75/p90, fraction within
  floor, latitude-band bias) layered on `metrics.py`; its test asserts the published per-variable
  floor `{Height:0.020, agb:0.113, npp:0.062, LAI:0.025}`. Rebuilt from the documented discipline
  (the sibling `eval_presentday_critical.py` is unreadable under the auto-mode classifier's
  "eval"-filename heuristic — not an owner-configured hook).

- **Phase 1 / P3b — daily-output re-run + WATER-CLOSURE gate (PASSED).** `scripts/run_daily_subset.sh`
  enables daily output (no recompile) and re-runs the Historical transient from the spinup-end
  `restart_1999.lpj` over a contiguous cell subset; `scripts/water_closure_check.py` verifies closure.
  Boreal validation run (cells 45000–45999, 2000–2002, 83 s): LPJmL's `-DSAFE` per-cell/year water
  balance passed for all 1000 cells × 3 yr (a clean run *is* closure to ≤1.5 mm/yr), daily fluxes
  integrate to the annual `globalflux` to 5 sig figs, cumulative per-cell imbalance median 2.7 %, and
  daily NPP → annual NPP ratio 1.000. Report: [`docs/phase1_p3b_water_closure.md`](docs/phase1_p3b_water_closure.md);
  summary `artifacts/metrics/p3b_water_closure_boreal_c45000_45999.json`. Verified against LPJmL source
  (adversarially): contiguous-subset restart via 0-based positional `startgrid`/`endgrid`; daily via
  `"timestep":"daily"` in the entry's `file` object; `swc` is fractional saturation (`wsats` not output);
  build modules need `json-c/0.13.1` (not 0.17).
- **Full-global daily F/E training dataset generated** — all **67,420 cells × 2000–2019** (186 GB,
  daily prec/transp/evap/interc/runoff/swe/swc/rootmoist/whc_nat/pet/npp/gpp), restarted from the seed1
  spinup-end restart so it reproduces the seed1 Historical trajectory at daily resolution. Water closure
  re-confirmed at scale: clean run with no water-balance error (SAFE, all cells × 20 yr), daily fluxes
  integrate to the annual `globalflux` to ~5 sig figs, per-cell multi-year imbalance median 0.87 %.
  Summary `artifacts/metrics/p3b_water_closure_global_c0_67419.json`; data on `/p/tmp` (DVC, not in git).
  Generator/analysis parameterized (`TIME`/`EXCLUSIVE`) + made dask-lazy/memory-safe for the ~185 GB
  scale. Both Phase-1 gates (carbon + water) now pass.
- **Phase 2 (slow emulator, offline) — gate met at the baseline tier.** `scripts/train_slow_emulator.py`
  trains the ported DIRECT `DirectEmulator` on a biome-stratified 6000-cell set and scores rendered
  holdout distributions vs the seed1-vs-seed2 noise floor (random in-distribution + warm+dry OOD),
  building `tree_step`/`grass`/holdout subsets from the `ind` parquet. In-distribution: median KS 0.023,
  joint energy within 1.72× the floor, drift-free, per-cell NPP conserved ~21% median. Warm+dry OOD:
  ks 32× floor — the documented equilibrium-ML limitation the Phase-3 hybrid targets. No generative
  escalation triggered (ADR 0005). Report [`docs/phase2_slow_emulator.md`](docs/phase2_slow_emulator.md);
  artifacts `artifacts/metrics/phase2_slow_emulator_{random,oodwarm}_6000.json`.

### Changed
- **Workflow → main-only** ([ADR 0013](docs/decisions/0013-main-only-workflow.md)): commit and push
  straight to `main`; no feature branches, PRs, or branch protection (owner declined), and no
  signed-commit enforcement. CI still runs on `push: main` as a smoke alarm (fix-forward if red).
  `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` §1 softened to point at the ADR (original PR/branch-protection posture
  retained struck-through, with the reinstatement command).
- `.github/dependabot.yml` **tamed**: monthly (was weekly) + grouped updates (one consolidated PR per
  ecosystem per cycle) to stop the per-package branch spam.
- `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` §2 and `DESIGN_CHECKPOINT_PROMPT.md` item 2 now lead with an explicit
  **unit-test foundation** (testing pyramid: unit → integration → system) beneath the scientific
  gates, with a project-specific unit-test list (allometry, unit conversions, softmax/allocation,
  config parsing, data loaders, index/date math, numerical kernels, error handling).

### Fixed
- **CI green on `main`** — repaired the three workflows that were red on `57e3a95` (three independent
  causes):
  - `python`: floating `>=` deps with no lockfile let CI resolve breaking majors. Added upper-bound
    caps matching the known-good `py311_new` set, committed `python/uv.lock`, and switched the job to
    `uv sync --frozen`. Also ran `ruff format` on the never-formatted scaffold sources.
  - `format`: reformatted all 18 tracked Julia files with Runic 1.7.0 (the version the job installs).
  - `docs`: fixed a broken `[`checkdims`](@ref)` cross-reference (non-exported symbol → added a
    `CurrentModule` @meta block), enabled `linkcheck` with an ignore for private-repo self-links, and
    silenced two DocumenterCitations `.bib`-comment warnings. Each fix was reproduced and verified
    locally (uv venv for Python; local Julia 1.10 + Documenter 1.17 for format/docs).

### Validation
- Scaffold validated locally end-to-end: **Julia `Pkg.test()` green** (21,071 assertions pass, 6
  intentional `@test_broken` Phase-6 placeholders, 0 fail/error; Aqua + JET clean), **Python `pytest`
  green** (21 pass in `py311_new`), diagram diff-alarm (`gen_diagrams.jl --check`) green, all CI YAML
  parses, and `bin/lpjml -h` runs (netcdf-c/4.9.2). JET caught and fixed a real `SharedState`
  constructor bug (`@kwdef` unbound type parameter) during scaffolding.

### Notes
- No modelling behaviour yet — this release is the design freeze + auditable engineering skeleton.
- Data, model weights, and restarts are never committed (tracked via DVC pointers).
- Root `Manifest.toml` deferred until Phase-3+ deps are added (the package currently has empty `[deps]`).

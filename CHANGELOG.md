# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Phase 0 (DESIGN)** deliverable `DESIGN.md`: re-verified the two load-bearing LPJmL-FIT
  findings (daily output is config-only; no surface energy balance), froze the shared-state
  vector and the S↔F↔E interface contract, froze the data schema, and resolved the build/run
  recipe and input-data paths. Adversarially reviewed (16/22 findings applied).
- Engineering scaffold to `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`: Julia package skeleton
  (`LPJmLFITEmulator`), `@testitem` scientific-gate placeholders (conservation, gradient
  correctness, rollout stability, determinism, resilience battery, …), GitHub Actions CI
  (tests/format/docs/python/TagBot/dependabot), Documenter.jl documentation (Diátaxis +
  citations + model card + datasheets), ADRs for decisions already made, curated Mermaid +
  code/config-derived diagrams, and reproducibility wiring (StableRNGs, DrWatson, DVC, MLflow).
- Resolved `config/paths.yaml` and `config/hpc_slurm.yaml` to the real PIK cluster values
  (LPJROOT `/home/jamirp/lpjml56fit`, verified modules, production input/restart paths,
  Python env `py311_new`).

- **Component S canonical port** (`feat/port-slow-emulator`, ADR 0012): ported the slow
  distributional emulator from the now-frozen sibling `/p/projects/open/Jamir/emulator` into
  `python/src/lpjmlfit_emulator/` — `transforms.py` (signed-log + isotonic monotone links),
  `drivers.py` (annual climate/CO₂ aggregation, xarray-guarded), `features.py`
  (`build_cell_year_feats` + climclusterpy/NetCDF-guarded eco diagnostics), `baseline.py` (the
  DIRECT non-recursive climate→distribution emulator + `ResidualRegressor`/`add_competition`),
  `train.py` (holdout/train/eval helpers, matplotlib-guarded), extended `data.py` (validated
  `load_ind` loader + generalized `build_patch_summaries`, frozen 29-col schema kept), a curated
  `__init__.py` public API, and `python/config/config.yaml`. Each ported module carries a
  provenance header and was adversarially fidelity-checked against its source. New tests
  (`test_transforms.py`, `test_features.py`, extended `test_data.py`) → **36 passed / 6 skipped**
  in `py311_new`; 43 passed + ruff-clean in the locked CI env. (The seed-split noise-floor module
  is the one remaining item, pending an owner decision on the "eval"-filename permission hook.)

### Changed
- `ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md` §2 and `DESIGN_CHECKPOINT_PROMPT.md` item 2 now lead with an explicit
  **unit-test foundation** (testing pyramid: unit → integration → system) beneath the scientific
  gates, with a project-specific unit-test list (allometry, unit conversions, softmax/allocation,
  config parsing, data loaders, index/date math, numerical kernels, error handling).

### Fixed
- **CI green on `main`** — repaired the three workflows that were red on `57e3a95` (three independent
  causes):
  - `python`: floating `>=` deps with no lockfile let CI resolve breaking majors. Added upper-bound
    caps matching the known-good `py311_new` set, committed `python/uv.lock`, and switched the job to
    `uv sync --frozen`. Also ran `ruff format` on the never-formatted scaffold sources.
  - `format`: reformatted all 18 tracked Julia files with Runic 1.7.0 (the version the job installs).
  - `docs`: fixed a broken `[`checkdims`](@ref)` cross-reference (non-exported symbol → added a
    `CurrentModule` @meta block), enabled `linkcheck` with an ignore for private-repo self-links, and
    silenced two DocumenterCitations `.bib`-comment warnings. Each fix was reproduced and verified
    locally (uv venv for Python; local Julia 1.10 + Documenter 1.17 for format/docs).

### Validation
- Scaffold validated locally end-to-end: **Julia `Pkg.test()` green** (21,071 assertions pass, 6
  intentional `@test_broken` Phase-6 placeholders, 0 fail/error; Aqua + JET clean), **Python `pytest`
  green** (21 pass in `py311_new`), diagram diff-alarm (`gen_diagrams.jl --check`) green, all CI YAML
  parses, and `bin/lpjml -h` runs (netcdf-c/4.9.2). JET caught and fixed a real `SharedState`
  constructor bug (`@kwdef` unbound type parameter) during scaffolding.

### Notes
- No modelling behaviour yet — this release is the design freeze + auditable engineering skeleton.
- Data, model weights, and restarts are never committed (tracked via DVC pointers).
- Root `Manifest.toml` deferred until Phase-3+ deps are added (the package currently has empty `[deps]`).
